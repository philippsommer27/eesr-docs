Data centers can achieve higher sustainability by adjusting their operations to the tune of clean energy production (e.g. load shifting). DC4Cities proposed in 2014 a metric which captures how much the energy consumption profile of a data center matches the availability of renewable and green energy: Adaptability Power Curve at Renewable Energies.

## Formula

$$
APC_{ren} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} |K E_{Ren i} - E_{DC i}|} {\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{Ren i}}
$$

$$
K = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{DC i}} {\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{Ren i}}
$$

Where

* _Ereni_ is the renewable energy production on the grid (or onsite) in kWh,
* _EDCi_ is the total energy consumption of the data center in kWh,
* _K_ serves as an adjustment factor to meaningfully compute $E\_{ren i}$ against $E\_{DC i}$,
* _i_ is the time period, and
* _n_ is the sample size

As the amount of renewable electricity on the grid is far higher than what a data center consumes, K is needed to equalize their magnitudes.

## Evaluation

Has not been used in the industry.

## Improvement Strategies

Load shifting.
